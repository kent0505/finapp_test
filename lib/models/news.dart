        'Stellantis will move forward on plan to build new midsize truck in Illinois',
    content:
        "By David Shepardson and Nora Eckert\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Chrysler parent Stellantis is moving forward with plans to build a new midsize pickup truck in Belvidere, Illinois, the company said on Wednesday.\n\nIn August, Stellantis said it was delaying its planned investments at the Illinois plant. Stellantis in 2023 agreed to build a new \$3.2 billion battery plant and invest \$1.5 billion in Belvidere to build new midsize trucks by 2027. The Italian-American automaker told employees about the investment plans on Wednesday in a memo seen by Reuters.\n\nStellantis Chair John Elkann met with President Donald Trump last week and touted the company's U.S. strategy.\n\nThe Belvidere factory has been a battleground for the United Auto Workers union since its six-week strike against Detroit's automakers in late 2023.\n\nIn September 2024, the union filed unfair labor practice charges against the automaker, partly because it said Stellantis was delaying planned investments into a new battery plant and factory in Belvidere.\n\nA company spokesperson said on Wednesday the new midsize truck is \"planned to take full advantage of our multi-energy strategy,\" including options for a gasoline-powered vehicle, plug-in hybrid and electric vehicle.\n\nProduction of the Dodge Durango has also been a sticking point between the union and company, with the union previously claiming Stellantis planned to offshore production of the three-row SUV.\n\nStellantis is moving forward with plans to build the next-generation Dodge Durango at its assembly complex in Detroit, the company said in the memo.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Nora Eckert in DetroitEditing by Matthew Lewis)",

        'By Medha Singh\n\nReuters Oracle\'s shares jumped nearly 9% before the bell on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said the company would make a large investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure, alongside OpenAI and SoftBank.\n\nThe joint venture, called Stargate, plans to invest \$500 billion to help the United States stay ahead of China and other rivals in the global AI race, Trump said at the White House on Tuesday.\n\nThe venture plans to deploy \$100 billion immediately, with the remaining investment over the next four years. Construction of the project\'s first data centers has already started in Texas.\n\nNvidia, which will supply chips for the venture, rose 2.7%, while the JV\'s other tech partners also gained, with Microsoft up 1.1% and Arm climbing 5.5%.\n\nFutures tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 rose 0.8%.\n\nWe believe this is the start of a wave of massive AI investments to take place in the U.S. as we expect more big tech players to make announcements over the coming weeks, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.\n\nAI consumes vast amounts of energy to drive its immense computing power, boosting the demand for specialized data centers and electricity needed to power them.\n\nNuclear power company Vistra\'s stock rose 3.8%. Over the past 12 months, its shares have surged more than fourfold, in part due to increasing demand for clean, sustainable energy for data centers.\n\nAI server makers\' shares also gained, with Dell Technologies up 4.3% and Super Micro Computer rising 2.7%.

For Canada’s fifth-largest bank, that continues a trend that began earlier in the year. It said the credit picture improved despite a worsening economic outlook.\n\nOverall, the bank earned C\$1.9 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 31, up 24% from the prior year, and posted a return on equity of 13.4%. Both figures are on an adjusted basis.\n\nCIBC has been in ‘execution mode,’ according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic, who said in a report last month that the bank is following a ‘relatively straightforward strategy that is neither aggressive nor conservative.’\n\nThe bank put aside C\$483 million for credit losses in the previous quarter and C\$541 million in the fourth quarter last year.\n\n--With assistance from Christine Dobby.",

    title: 'Foot Locker revises FY24 outlook as sales drop 1.4% in Q3',
    content:
        "Sportswear and footwear retailer Foot Locker has revised its outlook for the full fiscal year 2024 following a 1.4% drop in sales to \$1.95bn during the third quarter.\n\nThe decline is notable compared to the \$1.98bn reported in the same quarter of 2023.\n\nDespite the overall sales dip, comparable sales saw an increase of 2.4%, with global Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker showing 2.8% growth.\n\nChamps Sports and WSS banners also experienced positive comparable sales growth of 2.8% and 1.8% respectively.\n\nThe net loss for Foot Locker stood at \$33m in the quarter ended 2 November 2024, a stark contrast to its net income of \$28m in the corresponding period of the previous year. Loss per share was reported at \$0.34, down from earnings of \$0.30 per share in Q3 FY23.\n\nOn a non-GAAP [generally accepted accounting principles] basis, net income reached \$31m for the third quarter, slightly higher than the \$28m reported in the same period of 2023. Non-GAAP earnings per share were \$0.33, compared to \$0.30 in Q3 FY23.\n\nThe gross margin for Foot Locker increased by 230 basis points in Q3 FY24, driven by reduced markdown levels. However, this performance fell short of expectations due to an elevated promotional environment.\n\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of sales rose by 210 basis points, influenced by investments in technology and brand-building and partially offset by savings from cost optimisation efforts and ongoing expense discipline.\n\nFoot Locker president and chief executive officer Mary Dillon said: 'Our team's continued focus on execution drove positive comparable sales trends and meaningful gross margin expansion in the quarter. However, our third quarter top- and bottom-line performance fell short of our expectations. Consumer spending trends softened following the peak back-to-school period in August, and the promotional environment was more elevated than anticipated.'\n\nFor the full year, Foot Locker now anticipates sales to decline between 1.5% and 1%, adjusting previous expectations from a 1% decline to potential 1% growth.\n\nComparable sales are expected to grow between 1.0% and 1.5%, revised down from earlier forecasts of 1% to 3%.\n\nDillon further stated: 'Despite strong performance, we are taking a more cautious view and are lowering our full-year sales and earnings outlook due to a more promotional environment and softer consumer demand outside key selling periods.'\n\nIn the third quarter, Foot Locker opened ten new stores, closed 24, remodelled or relocated 20, and updated 167 stores to the latest design standards. As of 2 November 2024, the company operated 2,450 stores in 26 countries.\n\nIn April 2024, it revealed a new retail concept designed to improve shopping experience and customer service.\n\n'Foot Locker revises FY24 outlook as sales drop 1.4% in Q3' was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.",

        'XRP Outperforms Uber and Charles Schwab in Market Cap, Macro Guru Calls XRP Chart In the ‘Banana Zone’',
    content:
        "XRP is on a record-breaking rally, cementing its spot as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nXRP’s market cap has soared to \$150.18 billion, surpassing ride-hailing giant Uber at \$150.07 billion and financial services leader Charles Schwab International at \$148.49 billion.\n\nThis places XRP ahead of major companies like pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (\$144.85 billion), banking leader Citigroup (\$136.25 billion), and energy corporation ConocoPhillips (\$137.18 billion), according to Stock Analysis, which ranks XRP 68th among S&P 500 stocks.\n\nOn Dec. 3, XRP's market capitalization briefly surpassed that of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which holds \$158 billion in market capitalization.\n\nXRP also leads its closest crypto competitors, stablecoin Tether (\$135.1 billion) and Layer 1 blockchain Solana (\$112 billion).\n\n“XRP has flipped SOL in market cap. This was definitely not on my bingo card, but it shows how markets can sometimes react in totally unexpected ways,” wrote analysts from the Alpha Please newsletter. “The XRP army has shown us that they are stronger than we thought.”\n\nMassive Rally Fueled by Market Optimism\nXRP’s rally has been fueled by massive investor optimism, gaining 420% in the past 30 days. On Dec. 4, the token hit an intraday high of \$2.64, up from \$0.50 on Nov. 5. The all-time high for XRP was \$3.40, recorded on Jan. 7, 2018. Comparatively, the current price is 22.68% lower.\n\nA key factor behind XRP’s meteoric rise is Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Trump has pledged to make America the global hub for crypto by creating a friendlier regulatory environment, including firing Securities and Exchange Commissioner (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nUnder Gensler’s leadership, the SEC cracked down on the crypto industry, filing lawsuits against major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for alleged violations of U.S. securities laws. In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs, claiming it raised over \$1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering of XRP.\n\nRipple contested the claim, arguing XRP functions as a digital currency, not a security. In a landmark July 2023 ruling, Judge Analisa Torres decided Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP on public exchanges were not securities transactions. However, she ruled institutional XRP sales were securities offerings, prompting the SEC to appeal in October 2024.\n\nThe resignation of Gensler in November and Trump’s pro-crypto stance have fueled hopes in the crypto industry that Ripple Labs may see regulatory relief under the new administration.\n\nRipple Labs is also garnering attention amid plans to launch a stablecoin, RLUSD.\n\nAccording to Fox Business, the New York Department of Financial Services is reviewing RLUSD for approval. If approved, Ripple could launch the stablecoin, potentially expanding XRP’s ecosystem.\n\nWhales Fuel the Rally\nWith a \$150 billion market cap, XRP now trails only Bitcoin and Ethereum among cryptocurrencies. Much of its momentum comes from whale activity, as large XRP holders drive trading dynamics.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Woominkyu noted that spikes in whale-to-exchange transactions often coincide with price peaks. Recent data showed whales transferring XRP to Binance as the token hit \$2.30, signaling potential profit-taking.\n\n“Whales tend to move large amounts of XRP to exchanges near local or cycle tops,” said Woominkyu. “This could indicate whales preparing for potential profit-taking or increased market activity.”\n\nKi Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytical firm, added, “Coinbase whales are driving this XRP rally. Over the past 30 days, Coinbase’s minute-level price premium ranged from 3% to 13% during the surge.”\n\nMacro Experts See More Upside\nVeteran trader Peter Brandt described XRP’s breakout as a “massive coil,” predicting strong bullish potential into 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, Raoul Pal, CEO of Global Macro Investor, called XRP’s chart “good-looking” and placed it in the “banana zone,” indicating it is primed for a price rally.",

    title: 'UK new car market slips back in November',
    content:
        "Deliveries of new cars in the UK fell by 1.9% in the UK during November with 153,610 units sold, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).\n\nIt is the second consecutive monthly decline, and the third decline in four months, as the market contracts amid the race to meet tough EV market share targets under the UK Government’s ZEV Mandate.\n\nDemand from private buyers, among whom uptake has waned for two years, dropped by 3.3% to 58,496 units. Fleet purchases, which represent the bulk (59.9%) of the market, fell by 1.1% to 91,993 units, while low-volume business demand rose by 5.2% to 3,121 units.\n\nAccording to GlobalData forecasts, the UK car market will be virtually flat this year, with little growth expected in 2025.\n\nNovember saw double-digit falls in registrations of petrol (17.7%) and diesel (10.1%) cars, with petrol remaining the most popular powertrain. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid uptake also declined, by 3.6% and 1.2% respectively.\n\nBattery electric vehicle (BEV) registrations, meanwhile, rose for an eleventh successive month, up 58.4% to 38,581 units, representing 25.1% of the overall market but driven by heavy manufacturer discounting.\n\nWith the best market share since December 2022, November is just the second month this year in which BEV uptake has reached ZEV Mandate levels (22% target share for the year – but year-to-date share is at 18.7%), albeit against the backdrop of a declining overall market.\n\nThe SMMT noted that market demand for EVs remains weak and below the levels expected when the ZEV Mandate regulation was drawn up by the previous government. The industry now expects the UK’s BEV market share to be 18.7% in 2024, although a strong December performance could raise that to 19% – still, however, short of the 22% mandated target for the year.\n\nThis year’s growth nevertheless cements Britain as Europe’s second biggest new BEV market by volume and ‘closing the gap on leader Germany’. However, the SMMT also warns that the scale of discounting, worth some £4 billion across 2024, is ‘unsustainable and poses a risk to future consumer choice and UK economic growth’.\n\nOnce again, the SMMT called for government support to stimulate EV sales. It said that BEV car registrations will need to grow by an additional 53% in 2025 if next year’s 28% ZEV Mandate target is to be met – an ambitious looking level on current BEV demand trends.\n\nMike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said: “Manufacturers are investing at unprecedented levels to bring new zero emission models to market and spending billions on compelling offers. Such incentives are unsustainable – industry cannot deliver the UK’s world-leading ambitions alone.\n\n“It is right, therefore, that government urgently reviews the market regulation and the support necessary to drive it, given EV registrations need to rise by over a half next year. Ambitious regulation, a bold plan for incentives and accelerated infrastructure rollout are essential for success, else UK jobs, investment and decarbonisation will be at further risk.”",

        'OPEC+ oil alliance faces stagnant prices for crude while US drivers enjoy cheaper gasoline',
    content:
        "FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries will decide Thursday whether to put off plans to pump more crude amid sluggish demand and competing production from non-allied countries -- factors that could keep oil prices stagnant into next year.\n\nKey beneficiaries of that would be U.S. motorists, who have seen gasoline prices fall to their lowest in 2 1/2 years to near \$3 a gallon.\n\nOPEC+, which includes Saudi Arabia as the dominant member of the OPEC producers' cartel, and Russia as the leading non-OPEC member in the 23-country alliance, is holding an online meeting over whether to put off production increases that are scheduled to take effect Jan. 1.\n\nEight OPEC+ members planned to start increasing production from Jan. 1 by gradually restoring 2.2 million barrels per day in previous production cuts. Analysts now say the group could postpone production increases for another three months as it monitors demand.\n\nOil prices have been slack due to weaker than expected demand from China as well as increased production from countries like Brazil and Argentina that aren't in OPEC+. Oil analysts have been busy reducing their estimates for demand for next year, meaning that OPEC+ could remain in a bind well into 2025.\n\nThe Saudis need oil revenue to carry out Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s ambitious plans to diversify his country’s economy, including the development of Neom, a \$500 billion futuristic city in the desert. For Russia, oil export revenues are a key pillar of state finances and funding for the war against Ukraine. Holding back production risks losing market share. Yet increasing production and sales could lower prices in a global economy that analysts say is already well supplied with oil.\n\nU.S. oil has been stuck around \$70 per barrel and traded at \$68.92 on Thursday ahead of the meeting, down from \$80 in August. International benchmark Brent crude traded at \$72.66 per barrel, down from around \$80 in July.\n\nOne result of those slack prices is that U.S. average pump prices for gasoline fell to \$3.03 a gallon this week, the lowest since May, 2021 and well down from their record peak of \$5.02 from June, 2022, according to motoring club AAA.\n\nThirty-one U.S. states now have average gas prices below \$3 a gallon.\n\nU.S. oil price levels of \$70 or less “are great for consumers,” said AAA spokesman Andrew Gross. Crude oil makes up about half the price of a gallon of gasoline, making crude the key factor on top of distribution costs and taxes. Motorists in Europe see far smaller fluctuations because taxes make up a much bigger chunk of the cost.\n\nOPEC has cut its forecast for 2025 demand growth to 1.54 million barrels per day, from 1.85 million barrels per day in July. That is at the high end of estimates compared to those from the International Energy Agency at 990,000 barrels per day, U.S. Energy Information Administration at 1.22 million and energy intelligence firm Rystad Energy at 1.1 million.\n\nAnalysts at Commerzbank foresee Brent prices averaging \$75 per barrel in the first quarter of next year and \$80 for the remaining three quarters.\n\nIn the United States, Donald Trump’s return to the White House will likely lead to more fossil fuel production. Not only has the President-elect campaigned on more drilling, but his Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent has put together an economic plan with the goal of increasing domestic oil production by the equivalent of 3 million barrels a day. Bessent has indicated that the additional oil production would reduce inflationary pressures for U.S. consumers. But the Trump team has not fully outlined why oil producers would ramp up supplies and lower prices to levels that could hurt their profits.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1960, by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. It has since expanded to 12 member countries. In 2016, largely in response to dramatically falling oil prices due to U.S. shale oil output, OPEC signed an agreement with 10 other oil-producing countries to create OPEC+.",

    title: 'Bitcoin soars above \$103,00 in record-smashing run',
    content:
        "The original currency notched a new all-time high on Wednesday, breaking through the psychological barrier of \$100,000 and then climbing even higher. The surge comes amid a climate of broader exuberance in the crypto industry, which is anticipating that the election of Donald Trump will lead to looser regulation and more blockchain innovation in the U.S.\n\nBitcoin punched through the \$100,000 mark around 9:30pm Eastern Time and continued to climb on Wednesday evening, trading for around \$103,600 before giving up some of those gains. Bitcoin was trading around \$103,000 at midnight EST.\n\nCrypto markets are notoriously volatile and, unlike the stock market, it is hard to identify an exact price since there is slight discrepancy across different exchanges. On Wednesday night, Bitcoin was trading above \$100,000 on every exchange while other cryptocurrencies soared too.\n\nThe price for so-called alt-coins soared too with the tokens for blockchains like Ethereum and Dogecoin climbing around 7%. Unlike earlier phases of crypto, however, the Bitcoin rally did not lift all coins.\n\nSolana, the prime competitor to Ethereum, stayed mostly flat. Meanwhile, the XRP tokens associated with the blockchain firm Ripple dropped around 10%—the drop, though came after XRP climbed a remarkable 65% or so in the last week.\n\nThe new record high for Bitcoin came the same day President-elect Donald Trump announced he had selected Paul Atkins, a libertarian and former regulator, to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. The crypto market responded to the Atkins's proposed appointment with glee. Atkins is slated to succeed current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, an acolyte of progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren who is virulently anti-crypto and is widely despised by blockchain executives and many in the broader financial community for his aggressive regulatory strategy.\n\nMore broadly, the crypto market has climbed thanks to the massive popularity of new ETFs launched by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity, which provided conservative investors with a way to buy Bitcoin in the form of shares.\n\nBitcoin's latest all-time high comes amid a new crypto bull market that gained steam early this year, when Bitcoin was trading for around \$42,000.\n\nThe current price mania comes as crypto is in the midst of its fourth major bull cycle. Launched in 2009, Bitcoin—the original cryptocurrency—traded for pennies in its early years before its first big breakout in 2013, which saw it cross \$1000. Subsequent boom periods saw Bitcoin hit an all-time high of just below \$20,000 in 2017, and then hit a new high of around \$65,000 in 2021.",
